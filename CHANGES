- Added 2 instances of skos:ConceptScheme (Wordnet 3.0 Princeton and
  openWordnet-PT). Connected all synsets for one of those
  ConceptSchemes.

- I moved the information of BaseConcept from the instances in
  openWordnet-PT to WN.Pr.

- I removed 444 wrong tuples with instances of WordSense connected to
  WN.Pr ConceptScheme (above) using skos:inScheme.
