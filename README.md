# Open-WordNet-PT

## About the initial file

The initial file was generated by combining the following data:

- Princeton WordNet 3.0 was used to obtain English glosses and English
  terms for synset IDs.

- The unreleased 2010-12 version UWN and MENTA provided candidate
  terms in Portuguese, candidate glosses in Portuguese (from
  Wikipedia), and candidate terms in Spanish.

- The EuroWordNet base concept list (`5000_bc.xml`) provides the base
  concept numbers. The original file was mapped from WordNet 2.0 to
  3.0 using the mappings from
  [WN-Map](http://nlp.lsi.upc.edu/web/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=21&Itemid=57). When
  multiple mappings for a WordNet 2.0 synset existed, all possible
  WordNet 3.0 synsets were kept. Hence, there may be multiple entries
  with the same base concept number.
  

## About the RDF conversion

- Based on http://www.w3.org/TR/wordnet-rdf/ and
  http://semanticweb.cs.vu.nl/lod/wn30/ with some modifications. More
  files from the Princeton distribution were considered and not only
  the database files. More properties and classes are included.
  
- Lisp code used to create the RDF files will be made available soon.

- The wordnet-br.rdf is not a complete wordnet. All relations are in
  the wordnet-en.rdf (the original Princeton WordNet 3.0).

## Converting to Open Universal Wordnet format

1. Load the wordnet-br.rdf in a triple store.
2. Execute and export as csv file the result of the SPARQL 1.1 query:

```
select ?part ?w {
  ?ss wn30:containsWordSense/wn30:word/wn30:lexicalForm ?w ;
  wn30:synsetId ?id .
  BIND (str(?ss) as ?s)
  BIND (substr(?s,55) AS ?part)
}
```

3. Run the awk command on the output of the query:

```
awk -F ',' 'BEGIN {OFS = "\t"} {gsub(/"/,""); gsub(/_/," "); print $1, "lemma", $2;}' query.csv > wn-data-por.tab
```

4. Include the first line 

```
